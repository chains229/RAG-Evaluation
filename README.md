# **Evaluating RAG Systems**

Our code produces emperical results in our research, which basically proposed a benchmark in evaluating RAG systems using Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. We don't even know if we can ever publish the paper.

# How to run
Use our notebook (.ipynb) file, maybe you will understand all the code and instructions I wrote. I hope it will work.

# To-do
- Code reference-required metrics
- Code post-processing emperical result functions to write report
- Create a GUI using Streamlit for more user-friendly evaluation process.
